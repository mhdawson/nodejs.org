# Summary
The Node.js project will be releasing new versions of 4.x, 6.x, 8.x and 9.x as soon as possible after the OpenSSL release, on or soon after December 8th UTC, to incorporate a security fix.

# Data Confidentiality/Integrity Vulnerability

All versions of 4.x, 6.x, 8.x and 9.x are vulnerable to an issue to be fixed in the forthcoming OpenSSL-1.0.2n released on Dec 7, see https://mta.openssl.org/pipermail/openssl-announce/2017-December/000108.html for more details. The severity of this vulnerability of Node.js is HIGH (due to the way Node.js uses the OpenSSL APIs) and users of the affected versions should plan to upgrade when a fix is made available.

# Impact

* Versions 6.0 and later of Node.js are vulnerable
* Versions 8.0 and later of Node.js are vulnerable
* Versions 9.0 and later of Node.js are vulnerable

# Release timing
Releases will be available as soon as possible after the OpenSSL release, along with disclosure of the details for the vulnerability in order to allow for complete impact assessment by users.
